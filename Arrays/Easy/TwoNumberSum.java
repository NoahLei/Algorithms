/**
 * Two Number Sum
 * Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target
 * sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in
 * an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty
 * array.
 * Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; you can't add
 * a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
 * You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
 * targetSum = 10
 * <p>
 * Sample Output
 * [-1, 11] // the numbers could be in reverse order
 *
